# Bike Sharing Assignment


A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

## Conclusion
1.  We can see that demand of Bike is mainly depend on yr,holiday,temp,windspeed,season_spring,season_winter,weathersit_Light_Rain,mnth_Jul and mnth_sep.
2. Bike demand increases means cnt increase when all positive co efficient variable increase means yr,temp,season_winter,mnth_sept.
3. Bike demand decreases'cnt' with negative co efficient which is holiday,windspeed,season_spring,weathersit_Light_Rain and mnth_Jul.
4. temp variable is most significant variable for target variable cnt because it has highest coeffiecient.
